# Dice-Roller
This is a dice/die roller I made in response to a challenge on Reddit. This was supposedly for D&amp;D and you basically input the specs of the die and it randomly rolls it and returns the sum. 
---
You input the the specs as follows: \[number of rolls\]\[d\]\[number of sides\].
You can input any other character instead of 'd' to quit the program.
